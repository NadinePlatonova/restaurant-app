# Pizza Pazza Restaurant App

![project demonstration](public/Pizza-Pazza.gif)

## About Project

This is my pet project designed to improve my skills in Next.js, Tailwind, and TypeScript. The goal was to create a frontend for a restaurant application, featuring Home, Menu, Single Product, Login, and Cart pages. When a menu item is clicked, it opens on a separate page displaying the product's description, sizes, and quantities.

The project is currently not complete. Future improvements include making it full stack to enable image uploads from the server, saving products to the cart, implementing login and logout functionalities, and developing a full-fledged application for ordering food from a restaurant.
